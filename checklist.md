MVP of the library:

  Support for:
    [X] named tuples
    [X] tuples
    [X] options
    [] collections

  Modifiers:
    [] single-element .add
    [] single-element .compute
    [X] update
    [] remove (both named and positional tuples)
    field renames:
      [] locale
      [] regional

  Other:
    [] sane errors

Further ideas:
  * deep merging
  * turn a case class hierarchy into a named tuple/back to a case class
